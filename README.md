# Order Route Optimization

## Vision

To produce a system people can use to leave their Plants at place where they can be taken care of.

## This Project

Allow a small collection center at a heavily populated area(Expensive) send its contents to another larger facilty far from population(Cheaper) in a way that we optimize the number of trips made and reduce the distance traveled to further save fuel.
